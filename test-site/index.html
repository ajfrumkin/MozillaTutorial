    <p>I would like to make this website about my career and education, but include a section about my hobbies.</p> 
    <p>Career-wise, I want to highlight my achievements, growing from an entry-level meteorologist to a project manager to a director of operations leading a team of 7 people.</p> 
    <p>In the section about my hobbies I I intend to have a subsection about my cycling adventures and another section about training my new dog Ebony. Enjoy!</p>
